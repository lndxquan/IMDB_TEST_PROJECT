This is a relatively simple movie statistics Python program that uses an API to fetch statistics. 

imdb_fecting.py is used to grab movie statistics and the user needs to run this file first. Due to the anti-crawler settings on the IMDB website, this program uses an API to get the data. Most APIs require a fee, and APIs to get the latest data are more expensive. IMDB's website recommends using AWS to do the API fetching, provided you sign up for an AWS account and subscribe to the IMDB API. Getting a valid API is a prerequisite for this program to run. 

Note that because AWS provides more than one IMDB subscription, this will result in different definitions of fields for the user's actual API, and you will need to refer to this program to complete the replacement of the corresponding fields, which is a very easy task. Most of the APIs have detailed descriptions of the definition of field attributes. And note that the IMDB APIs on AWS have expiration dates, and some of the cheaper products are only valid for one time.

The process.py file is the data processing file, the data obtained by IMDB_fecting.py is in csv format, the encoding is UTF-8, which is the common encoding format. After importing the obtained file into python, you can run process.py to do the actual processing. The test environment for this program is JupyterLab in the Anaconda package. No additional runtime libraries are required.
